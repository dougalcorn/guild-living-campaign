City of Luskin
Letter,
- Not much guild presence there, eladrin mainly took care of their own affairs. Local prominent businessman
- Jorildyn Eyninoar - requested a small team for assistance
- Use a portal to travel to market square in the city.
- Busy city, dewarves, elves, eladrin
- As an orc, we stand out
- People saw a band of soldiers come into town pretty bloodied and head into the merchant's districts
*** Jorildyn's house
- Merchant's district is about 100 houses. Very nice, larger. Well outside my own experience
- Inquire about Mr. Eyninoar, they speak of him with obvious respect. Pinpoint directions to his estate. The workers, laborers don't seem to like him
- Half-Orc doorman, jestures to sitting room.
- Middle-aged, dad-bod
- Need help resolving a robbery, which took place outside of the city. Yesterday afternoon, guards were attacked, robbed, and a few of them managed to make it out alive. Several collegues were killed. Darkies that stole it punished.
- This is a very unuqual event. Not sure how the route was determined or the event was planned.
- Vile elf-like creatures that live underground: Darkies
- They should all be destroyed.
- They were fortifying for the war: weapons from mages, things too complicated for us to understand
- provides horses.
