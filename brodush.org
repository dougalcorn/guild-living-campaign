#+title: Brodush
#+CONSTANTS: halflevel=3

* Name: Brodush
- Myth-Weavers Character Sheet: https://www.myth-weavers.com/sheets/?id=2925296
- [[https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/details/533427/guild-living-campaign][Guild Living Campaign]] -> [[https://app.roll20.net/editor/setcampaign/533427][Launch Game]]
Brodush's human mother was captured by a band of orcs and kept as a slave. The
tribe abused him because he was small and the son of a slave. He had to be quick
to avoid deadly battleaxes. He looted a greatbow after a tribal skirmish. Using
it it was finally able to escape the tribe and set out on his own.

He was able to form a bond with a hermit out in the wild. It was the hermit who
enchanted his bow. This hermit is who taught him to appreciate the balance of
nature: neither fear nor condemn the savagery of nature. Live in harmony with
the wild.

While Brodush identifies with Kord, it's more aspirational. Growing up in a wild
orc tribe, he's heavily influenced by Gruumsh. Slaughter and pillage is all he
new growing up. Kord gives him a way to harness that savagery rather than let it
flow out unbridled.
